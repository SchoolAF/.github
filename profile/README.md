# Hello there!

Welcome to schoolAF!

This organization used to keep my projects at school/colloege tasks, projects, assignments, practice, and exams related source codes.  
The codes might be retarded asf but yeah, not everything here is the final product.  
  
Instead, you can check my profile, or my projctes. Here is some of them:
- [conquerOS](https://github.com/ConquerOS)  
conquerOS is an Android distribution packed with simple features and redesigned UI. Optimized for Qualcomm Snapdragon devices.

- [chimeOSS](https://github.com/chimeOSS)  
Unified device source code for Xiaomi Redmi 9T and POCO M3. Currently the source code is not updated yet. I am taking rest on Android development so.. yeah.

- [Lunatic Clang](https://gitlab.com/Herobuxx/lunatic-clang)  
My own forked Clang LLVM. Actually it's only for personal usage, but if you want to use it. Branch ```09122022``` and newer requires GLIBC 2.35 or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. ```02122022``` and older requires GLIBC 2.31 or Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

- [Akebi](https://github.com/herobuxx/akebi)  
Akebi is a bash script used to display your machine information details. It's kinda stupid ngl.
